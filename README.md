# Scripts for an easy installation of the Calc/Solve package

The installation of the VLBI data analysis software [Calc/Solve](https://space-geodesy.nasa.gov/techniques/tools/calc_solve/calc_solve.html#:~:text=Calc%2FSolve%20is%20the%20GSFC%20VLBI%20Analysis%20Center%27s%20traditional,and%20velocities%2C%20source%20coodinates%2C%20and%20Earth%20orientation%20parameters.) has always
been a suffering process for me.
Therefore, I share the scripts used to make an easy installation of this
package.
There is also [a post](https://liuniu.fun/blogs/install_solve.html) written by me to show how to install Calc/Solve.
However, it was written in Chinese, which may be understandable with the help
of language translators.

The most recent installation of Calc/Solve is on 2022/02/01.
